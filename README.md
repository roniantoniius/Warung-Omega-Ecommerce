# Warung Omega

## Scope
Warung Omega is an e-commerce website designed to facilitate buying of seafood products by consumers without the involvement of businesses and hidden costs. The functions that a user will be able to perform in this platform are:
- Browse through the database of available product on different category.
- View Product dashboard
- Choose as much seafood product as you can
- Payment using debit/credit card
View receipt details
Wait for the seafood products to get delivered

## Problem
Warung Omega, a local seafood restaurant, seeks to expand its customer base and increase revenue by transitioning to a digital platform.

The primary challenge lies in developing an e-commerce website that effectively showcases the restaurant's diverse seafood offerings, facilitates seamless online ordering and payment processes, and ensures timely and reliable delivery. Additionally, the website must be user-friendly and visually appealing to attract a wider customer base.
